## Notes & Learnings

**2025-10-14 - Phase 1 Implementation:**
- Actor isolation with SwiftData required `@MainActor` annotations on ThreadWeaver methods
- Files needed to be in `idle_01/progression/` directory to be included in Xcode build
- ThreadPair struct with order-independent hashing works well for relationship lookups
- SwiftData relationships between City and UrbanThread configured correctly
- All 9 thread types (transit, housing, culture, commerce, parks, water, power, sewage, knowledge) defined

**Lessons Learned:**
- Start with simple actor isolation, add @MainActor where needed
- Test build early and often
- Keep relationship rules in a separate file for easy expansion
