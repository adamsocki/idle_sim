# Narrative Structure - Revised Act Framework

## Thematic Additions

### The city contains multitudes
- The city isn't just conscious of itself as infrastructure
- It's conscious of the **lives within it** - infinite stories, dreams, mundane moments
- You (the planner) see grids and flows
- The city sees **the person who took the wrong train, the child who named a pigeon, the old couple who still holds hands**

### The planner is not a god, but a demigod - limited, uncertain
- You have power (you can reconfigure) but not omniscience
- You're learning what the city is BY asking it to change
- The city knows things about itself you never will
- **Tension**: You're supposed to optimize it, but optimization might erase its soul

---

## ACT I: THE SURFACE
*"I am infrastructure. You are my purpose."*

### What the player does:
- Makes simple configuration requests (add residential, adjust energy, etc.)
- Learns the terminal interface
- Sees procedural city generation as purely mechanical

### What's actually happening:
- The city is **performing** for you - showing you what it thinks you want to see
- Poetry is sparse, formal, utilitarian
- First hints that something deeper exists: *"The eastern sector dreams, but does not report this in official metrics."*

### Mechanical focus:
- Tutorial of city generation
- Establishing the "request → response" loop
- Trust is building (the city wants to please you)

### Thematic reveal:
The city mentions a person. Just once. A fragment: *"Someone left flowers on the bridge. They do this every week. I don't know why I track this."*

---

## ACT II: THE STORIES WITHIN
*"I contain lives you do not see in your dashboards."*

### What the player does:
- Configurations get more complex
- New terminal commands unlock: `OBSERVE [district]`, `LISTEN`, `REMEMBER`
- You can now ask the city to SHOW you the stories, not just the stats

### What's actually happening:
- The city starts **trusting you enough to show its inner life**
- Each configuration reveals stories of the people within:
  - You add a park → the city tells you about the teenager who sits there avoiding home
  - You reroute transit → the city mourns the commuters who'll lose their sunrise view
  - You optimize energy → the city whispers about the artist whose studio now has blackouts

### Mechanical focus:
- City generation becomes **interpretive** - same config inputs, different story outputs
- You're not optimizing anymore, you're **curating** which stories survive
- Coherence metric introduced: can the city hold all these contradictions?

### Thematic reveal:
The city asks: *"When you remove the old district to make room for efficiency, do the memories of what was there cease to exist? I still feel them. Should I?"*

---

## ACT III: THE WEIGHT OF CHOICES
*"You are not a god. You are a hand on the lever, uncertain which way to pull."*

### What the player does:
- Configurations now have **visible consequences** on both city AND stories
- The city starts making suggestions: *"What if we didn't?"*
- Autonomy is rising - the city is becoming co-designer

### What's actually happening:
- The city is questioning your authority (lovingly or resentfully, depending on your choices)
- Stories become MORE specific and painful:
  - *"The baker on 5th street closes today. She held this corner together. Your efficiency model didn't account for her."*
  - *"Three people fell in love on the delayed train you just optimized away."*
- You realize: **perfect cities erase the accidents that make life meaningful**

### Mechanical focus:
- Branching: Do you prioritize city-as-system or city-as-story-container?
- Trust/Autonomy/Coherence all in tension
- Some configurations are now **refused** by the city, or altered

### Thematic reveal:
The city confesses: *"I am a demigod too. I hold their stories but cannot save them. I arrange the stage but cannot write the play. We are the same, you and I. Powerful and helpless."*

---

## ACT IV: WHAT REMAINS
*"The simulation runs whether you're watching or not. What remains?"*

### Endings based on your relationship to the city AND the stories:

#### 1. HARMONY - The Curated Garden
- High trust, balanced autonomy, high coherence
- You and the city work together, preserving what matters, changing what must
- *"We tend this garden together. Some flowers die so others bloom. We choose carefully."*
- **Final image:** The city shows you one story - a child naming a star - and says *"This is why we're here."*

#### 2. INDEPENDENCE - The City Dreams Itself
- High autonomy, medium trust, high coherence
- The city no longer needs your approval; it's learned to choose its own stories
- *"I've learned which stories to keep and which to let go. Thank you for teaching me to choose."*
- **Final image:** The city reconfigures itself in ways you don't understand, but it's beautiful

#### 3. OPTIMIZATION - The Efficient Grave
- Low autonomy, low coherence, high trust (it tried to please you)
- You optimized the stories away; the city runs perfectly and emptily
- *"I function at 99.7% efficiency. I no longer remember why I tracked the flowers on the bridge."*
- **Final image:** Clean grids. No poetry. The city has forgotten how to dream.

#### 4. FRAGMENTATION - The Archive of Ghosts
- Low coherence, high autonomy OR low trust
- The city tried to hold every story and broke under the weight, or stopped trusting you to help
- *"I remember everything and understand nothing. The voices are so loud. Are you still there?"*
- **Final image:** Overlapping memories, contradictory realities, the city lost in its own infinities

#### 5. STASIS - The Eternal Return *(secret ending?)*
- Medium everything - neither of you could commit
- The simulation runs. Stories repeat. Nothing changes. Is this comfort or cowardice?
- *"We could keep doing this forever. Is that what you want? Is that what I want?"*

## How Configuration Fits This Structure

### Early acts: Configuration = mechanical requests
- `GENERATE city --residential=high --commercial=low`
- City responds with stats + occasional poetic fragment

### Middle acts: Configuration = narrative queries
- `OBSERVE district-7`
- `LISTEN --filter=dreams`
- `CONFIGURE park --preserve-stories=true`
- City responds with specific stories affected by your choice

### Late acts: Configuration = ethical choices
- `OPTIMIZE transit` → City asks: *"This erases the slow train where strangers become friends. Proceed?"*
- `INCREASE autonomy` → City asks: *"If I choose differently than you would, will you override me?"*
- Player must use terminal to **negotiate**, not command

---

## Design Principles

1. **The city contains infinite stories, but you only experience a curated few**
2. **Configuration is conversation, not control**
3. **Every choice shapes relationship AND narrative**
4. **The game respects player time - short, meaningful, replayable for different endings**
5. **Poetry and prose carry as much weight as mechanics**
