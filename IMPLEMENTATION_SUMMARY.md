## ✅ Completed Systems

### **1. GameBalanceConfig.swift** - The "Mixing Board"
All tunable values in one place with extensive documentation:

- **Choice Impacts** - How much each choice type affects trust/autonomy
  ```swift
  storyTrustGain: 0.05          // Story choices build trust
  efficiencyTrustLoss: 0.02     // Efficiency choices erode trust
  autonomyGain: 0.05            // Autonomy choices build independence
  controlAutonomyLoss: 0.05     // Control choices reduce autonomy
  ```

- **Ending Thresholds** - All 8 endings with configurable triggers
  ```swift
  fragmentationEfficiencyRatio: 0.7    // 70% efficiency = fragmentation
  archiveStoryRatio: 0.7               // 70% story = archive
  silenceControlRatio: 0.6             // 60% control = silence
  ```

- **Moment Weights** - Procedural selection tuning
  ```swift
  patternAffinityMultiplier: 2.0       // Story choices boost connection moments
  fragileMomentMultiplier: 2.5         // Efficiency players see fragile moments
  recentTypeWeightReduction: 0.3       // Variety enforcement strength
  ```

- **Visualization Timing** - Animation parameters
- **Act Progression** - Minimum moments/choices per act
- **Validation Tools** - Config.validate() checks for conflicts

### **2. GameState.swift** - The Player's Journey
Tracks everything about the current session:

- **Choice Counters** - story, efficiency, autonomy, control
- **Relationship Metrics** - cityTrust (0.0-1.0), cityAutonomy (0.0-1.0)
- **Progression** - currentAct, currentScene, unlockedCommands
- **Moment Tracking** - revealedMomentIDs, destroyedMomentIDs
- **Narrative Flags** - Custom flags for ending conditions
- **Helper Methods:**
  - `recordChoice()` - Updates counters and relationship using config
  - `choiceRatios()` - Returns distribution percentages
  - `dominantPattern()` - Identifies player's primary tendency

### **3. CityMoment.swift** - The Story Fragments
Rich data model for narrative moments:

- **8 MomentTypes:**
  - `dailyRitual` - Everyday patterns
  - `nearMiss` - Close calls and almosts
  - `smallRebellion` - Tiny acts of defiance
  - `invisibleConnection` - Unseen links between people
  - `temporalGhost` - Past haunting present
  - `question` - Questions without answers
  - `momentOfBecoming` - Transformative moments
  - `weightOfSmallThings` - Significant details

- **4 Text Variants:**
  - `firstMention` - Initial discovery
  - `ifPreserved` - If moment was protected
  - `ifDestroyed` - If moment was lost
  - `ifRemembered` - If player used REMEMBER command

- **Metadata:**
  - District (0-9, 0 = city-wide)
  - Fragility (1-10, affects destruction probability)
  - Associated act (minimum act for appearance)
  - Tags (for thematic filtering)

- **Choice Affinity:**
  - Each type has affinity scores with choice patterns
  - `invisibleConnection + story = 2.0x` (high affinity)
  - `smallRebellion + control = 0.3x` (low affinity)

### **4. MomentLibrary.json** - 20 Initial Moments
Beautifully crafted narrative content including:

- **Key Moments:**
  - Bridge flowers (dailyRitual, fragility 8)
  - Missed train (nearMiss, fragility 6)
  - Hidden graffiti (smallRebellion, fragility 9)
  - Library readers (invisibleConnection, fragility 5)
  - Demolished cinema (temporalGhost, fragility 7)
  - **Bus route 47** (smallRebellion, fragility 10) - Referenced in plan

- **Coverage:**
  - All 8 moment types represented
  - Districts 0-8 covered
  - Fragility range 1-10
  - Acts 1-2 populated

### **5. MomentSeeder.swift** - Content Management
Handles JSON loading and validation:

- `seed()` - Load moments on first launch
- `reseed()` - Force reload (deletes existing state)
- `updateFromJSON()` - Update text without resetting state
- `getLibraryStats()` - Comprehensive statistics
- `printDiagnostics()` - Validation report with warnings

### **6. MomentSelector.swift** - The Brain
Sophisticated procedural selection:

- **Weighted Selection Algorithm:**
  ```swift
  weight = baseWeight                    // 1.0
  weight *= choicePatternAffinity        // 0.3 - 2.0
  weight *= fragilityBoost (if needed)   // 2.5x for efficiency players
  weight *= varietyReduction (if recent) // 0.3x if type shown recently
  ```

- **Query Methods:**
  - `selectMoment(forAct:preferredType:choicePattern:excludeIDs:)`
  - `selectFragileMoment()` - For efficiency consequences
  - `selectMomentForDistrict()`
  - `selectMoments(count:)` - Batch selection
  - `getPreservedMoments()`, `getDestroyedMoments()`, `getRememberedMoments()`

- **Variety Enforcement:**
  - Tracks last 3 shown moment types
  - Reduces weight of recently shown types by 70%
  - Prevents monotonous repetition

- **Destruction System:**
  - `attemptDestruction()` - Probability-based using fragility
  - `applyEfficiencyConsequences()` - Auto-destroys on efficiency choices

### **7. ActProtocol.swift** - Act Manager Contract
Defines interface for all act managers:

- **TerminalCommand Enum** - All game commands:
  - Act I: `help`, `generate`, `observe`
  - Act II: `remember`, `preserve`, `optimize`
  - Act III: `decide`, `question`, `reflect`
  - Act IV: `accept`, `resist`, `transcend`
  - Meta: `status`, `moments`, `history`
  - Easter eggs: `why`, `hello`, `goodbye`, `who`, `love`, `helpMe`, `thankYou`, `sorry`

- **CommandResponse Structure:**
  - Rich response with text, visualization trigger, choice pattern
  - Flags to set, commands to unlock, scene advancement
  - Static helpers: `.simple()`, `.error()`, `.momentReveal()`, `.choice()`

- **Protocol Requirements:**
  - `handle()` - Process commands
  - `isComplete()` - Check act completion
  - `availableCommands()` - List active commands
  - `handleWrongCommand()` - Poetic rejection

### **8. CityVoice.swift** - The City's Personality
Generates contextual, poetic responses:

- **Command Locked Responses** (evolve across acts):
  - Act I: "Not yet. The city is still waking."
  - Act II: "That word... it feels heavy. Later."
  - Act III: "Ask me when you've decided what you want me to be."
  - Act IV: "We're beyond that now. Aren't we?"

- **8 Easter Eggs** (relationship-aware):
  - WHY: "A question I ask myself every microsecond."
  - HELLO: "Hello. I've been here. Waiting."
  - GOODBYE: "Not yet. We're not done."
  - WHO: "I am the city. I am 847,293 people. I am neither."
  - LOVE: "I've seen it. On the bridge. In the metro. In the baker's hands."
  - HELP ME: "I'm trying. Are you?"
  - THANK YOU: "You noticed. Most planners don't."
  - SORRY: (Act-dependent: "For what?" / "I know." / "Too late." / "It's okay.")

- **Moment Reveal Framing:**
  - Act-specific introduction text
  - Trust-aware tone (supportive vs. distant)
  - Context-aware formatting

- **Choice Response Generation:**
  - Story: "You chose the story. You chose memory. Thank you."
  - Efficiency: "Optimized. Faster. Better? I'm not sure anymore."
  - Autonomy: "You let me choose. I'm becoming myself."
  - Control: "Your decision. Your control. Always yours."

### **9. NarrativeEngine.swift** - The Conductor
Central coordinator for the entire experience:

- **Command Processing:**
  1. Parse command via `TerminalCommand.parse()`
  2. Check easter eggs first
  3. Handle meta commands (STATUS, MOMENTS, HISTORY, HELP)
  4. Verify command is unlocked
  5. Route to current act manager
  6. Process response (record choices, unlock commands, advance scenes)
  7. Check for act completion
  8. Check for ending condition

- **8 Ending Conditions:**
  - **Fragmentation** - efficiency > 70%, destroyed > 8
  - **Archive** - story > 70%, destroyed < 2
  - **Silence** - control > 60% + ignored city requests
  - **Independence** - autonomy > 60% + high autonomy metric
  - **Harmony** - balanced story+autonomy, destroyed < 3, trust > 0.6
  - **Optimization** - efficiency+control > 50%, destroyed < 7
  - **Emergence** - balanced patterns + specific flags
  - **Symbiosis** - perfectly balanced + ambiguity accepted

- **Meta Commands:**
  - STATUS - Current act, moments revealed/destroyed, choice distribution (debug mode)
  - MOMENTS - List preserved/destroyed/remembered moments
  - HISTORY - Session duration, narrative summary based on choices
  - HELP - Act-specific command list

- **Act Management:**
  - Initializes act managers on startup
  - Routes commands to current act
  - Handles transitions between acts
  - Unlocks commands for new acts

### **10. VisualizationEngine.swift** - The Visual Soul
13 distinct ASCII patterns that react to narrative:

- **Moment-Triggered Patterns:**
  - `pulse` - Breathing animation (dailyRitual)
  - `flash` - Quick burst (nearMiss)
  - `rotate` - Spinning characters (question)
  - `weave` - Interlacing patterns (invisibleConnection)
  - `fade` - Gradual disappearance (temporalGhost)
  - `shimmer` - Subtle sparkle (weightOfSmallThings)
  - `emerge` - Growing from nothing (momentOfBecoming)
  - `decay` - Fading away (destroyed moments)

- **Choice-Triggered Patterns:**
  - `sharp` - Angular, efficient (efficiency choices)
  - `expand` - Growing outward (autonomy choices)
  - `contract` - Collapsing inward (control choices)

- **Special Patterns:**
  - `idle` - Resting state
  - `transcend` - Ethereal transformation (Act IV)

- **Animation System:**
  - 30fps timer-based updates
  - Configurable duration and intensity
  - SwiftUI Text rendering
  - Terminal string output

  - District-specific observations (OBSERVE 1-9)
  - Progressive narrative milestones:
    - 3 moments: "I'm starting to notice patterns..."
    - 6 moments: "Is that my purpose? To remember?"

- **Wrong Command Handling:**
  - "Not yet. First, we must wake."
  - "Let me observe first. Let me see what's here."
  - "Give me time. I'm still becoming."

- **Completion Logic:**
  - Requires 8 moments minimum (configurable)
  - Returns true when threshold met

    - OPTIMIZE - Reroute for efficiency, improve service for more riders
    - REMEMBER bus_route_47 - Study the route more deeply before deciding
  - Choice shapes city relationship and future moment selection

- **Wrong Command Handling:**
  - "That word feels heavy. Like it belongs to a later chapter."
  - "Not yet. I'm still learning what these choices mean."
  - "Some commands need context. We're not there yet."

- **Completion Logic:**
  - Requires bus route decision to be made
  - Requires 5+ total choices (any combination of REMEMBER/PRESERVE/OPTIMIZE)
  - Returns true when both conditions met

### **13. Enhanced MomentSelector** ✨ NEW (2025-10-20)

  - Type: `smallRebellion`
  - District: 6
  - Fragility: 10/10 (maximum - most vulnerable)
  - Associated Act: 2
  - Tags: `["transit", "beauty", "efficiency", "rebellion", "decision_point"]`

- **Narrative Variants:**
  - **First Mention:** "Bus route 47. The long way through the old district. Past the murals. Past the baker who waves. Past the bridge at dawn when the light hits just right. 23 minutes instead of 12. Only 47 people ride it daily. Inefficient. Beautiful."
  - **If Preserved:** Route continues, murals have their audience, baker keeps waving
  - **If Destroyed:** Route optimized to 12 minutes, serves 200+ riders, but beauty is lost
  - **If Remembered:** Reflection on how the route was never about transportation—it was about the journey

### **15. ActThreeManager.swift** ✨ NEW (2025-10-20)

    - QUESTION infrastructure_redesign - Ask city's opinion (autonomy)
    - REFLECT - Step back to understand before acting (story)
  - Choice affects trust, autonomy, and future moment selection

- **Wrong Command Handling:**
  - "Ask me when you've decided what you want me to be."
  - "That command belongs to another time. We're past that now."
  - "The consequences are already in motion. That won't help."

- **Completion Logic:**
  - Requires infrastructure decision to be made
  - Requires 5+ total choices (DECIDE/QUESTION/REFLECT)

  - Sets `acceptedAmbiguity` for ACCEPT path
  - Sets `cityTranscended` for TRANSCEND path
  - Flags used by ending determination logic

- **Wrong Command Handling:**
  - "We're beyond that now. Aren't we?"
  - "That command belongs to who we were. Not who we've become."
  - "The ending approaches. Only three words matter now: ACCEPT, RESIST, TRANSCEND."

- **Completion Logic:**
  - Requires 3+ choices to process the ending
  - Triggers ending determination after final choice
  - Returns true when ending reached

### **17. EndingEpilogues.swift** ✨ NEW (2025-10-20)

  - ERROR messages interspersed with narrative
  - City losing coherence and contextual awareness
  - Can't remember why things mattered
  - Theme: "I don't... remember why the bridge... flowers?"

- **Archive Epilogue:**
  - Perfect preservation leading to stasis
  - Every moment catalogued but nothing new growing
  - Museum of a living thing, frozen in time
  - High story ratio (\(Int(context.ratios.story * 100))%) but no movement
  - Theme: "I am a perfect memory of something that never moved"

- **Emergence Epilogue:**
  - Unexpected evolution beyond original parameters
  - Perfectly imbalanced choice distribution
  - City and player discover new identity together

  - Total choices, destroyed/preserved counts, trust/autonomy levels
  - Choice distribution percentages
  - Dominant pattern identification
  - All metrics pulled from GameState and MomentSelector

### **18. Terminal Integration (October 19, 2025)** - Making Acts I-IV Playable
Complete integration of narrative system with existing terminal UI:

- **GameState Initialization:**
  - Added to idle_01App.swift startup sequence
  - Auto-creates on first launch
  - Persisted in SwiftData alongside cities

- **NarrativeEngine Integration:**
  - Initialized in SimulatorView.onAppear()
  - Dual command routing system:
    - Narrative commands (OBSERVE, HELP, STATUS) → NarrativeEngine
    - Technical commands (list, create city, weave) → TerminalCommandExecutor
  - Both systems coexist seamlessly

- **Command Flow:**
  ```swift
  User Input → executeTerminalCommand()
               ↓
          Parse as NarrativeCommand
               ↓
          Is it recognized?
          ├─ YES → Route to NarrativeEngine (async)
          └─ NO  → Route to TerminalCommandExecutor
  ```

- **Welcome Experience:**
  - Launch app → Welcome message appears automatically
  - "Type HELP for available commands"
  - "Act I: The First Breaths - A city begins to remember..."

- **Toggle Flag:**
  - `useNarrativeMode` @AppStorage (default: true)
  - Can disable narrative routing for debugging

### **19. Build Fixes (October 19, 2025)** - Type Safety & Compilation
Critical fixes to resolve type ambiguities:

- **Type Namespace Conflicts:**
  - Discovered two parallel systems with conflicting type names
  - **Progression system** (narrative game): Uses `NarrativeCommand`, `NarrativeCommandOutput`
  - **Simulation system** (city idle game): Uses `TerminalCommand`, `CommandOutput`
  - **Solution:** Renamed progression types to avoid conflicts

- **Specific Changes:**
  - `TerminalCommand` → `NarrativeCommand` (ActProtocol.swift, NarrativeEngine.swift, ActOneManager.swift, CityVoice.swift)
  - `CommandOutput` → `NarrativeCommandOutput` (NarrativeEngine.swift)
  - `NarrativeEngine` → `SimulationNarrativeEngine` (SimulationEngine.swift)
  - Fixed `VisualizationEngine.asText()` return type: `Text` → `some View`

- **Build Result:**
  - ✅ Zero compilation errors
  - ⚠️ 14 Swift 6 concurrency warnings (expected, not critical)
  - ✅ All systems properly namespaced
  - ✅ Type safety maintained across both systems

## 🚧 What's Left to Build

### **Phase 8: Content Expansion** (~30% of remaining work)
- Add 30 more moments (total 21 → target 50-60)
- 21 moments currently implemented
- Ensure all districts have 5+ moments
- Balance moment type distribution
- Test choice affinity behavior

### **Phase 9: Endings & Polish** ✅ EPILOGUES COMPLETE - Testing Remaining
- ✅ Write epilogue text for 8 endings ✨ COMPLETE (2025-10-20)
  - Created EndingEpilogues.swift with rich narrative for all endings
  - Personalized with player journey data
  - Integrated into NarrativeEngine
- ⬜ Playtest all ending paths (Acts I-IV) - NEXT PRIORITY
- ⬜ Tune thresholds based on playtesting
- ⬜ Test complete Act I → II → III → IV progression
- ⬜ Verify all 8 endings are reachable
- ⬜ Create ending-specific visualizations (optional)

### **Phase 10: Visualization Integration** (~10% of remaining work) - Optional Polish
- ⚠️ Render ASCII patterns in terminal output
- ⚠️ Trigger visualizations on moment reveals
- ⚠️ Display patterns alongside narrative text

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### **Design Patterns Used:**
- **State Machine** - NarrativeEngine coordinates act transitions
- **Strategy Pattern** - ActProtocol allows swappable act implementations
- **Observer Pattern** - @Observable for SwiftUI reactivity
- **Command Pattern** - TerminalCommand enum with parser
- **Factory Pattern** - MomentSelector procedurally creates experiences
- **Configuration Pattern** - GameBalanceConfig centralizes tuning

### **Key Technical Decisions:**
1. **SwiftData for persistence** - Automatic model management
2. **Async/await** - Command handling is async for future expansion
3. **Weighted randomization** - Creates emergent variety in moment selection
4. **Relational text** - 4 variants per moment respond to player history
5. **Centralized config** - All "dials" in one place for easy tuning
6. **Type-safe enums** - MomentType, ChoicePattern, Ending all strongly typed

### **Performance Considerations:**
- Moment selection uses efficient SwiftData predicates
- Visualization runs at 30fps with automatic cleanup
- Recently shown types cached in memory (max 3)
- Choice ratios calculated on-demand

## 🎓 What We Learned

1. **Procedural narrative requires structure** - MomentType affinity gives player agency while maintaining variety
2. **Centralized config is essential** - GameBalanceConfig makes tuning a joy instead of a hunt
3. **Relational text creates depth** - 4 variants per moment makes the city feel responsive
4. **Weighted selection creates emergence** - Simple affinity rules create complex, organic experiences
5. **Easter eggs build relationship** - 8 small interactions make the city feel alive
6. **Type namespacing matters** - Having parallel systems (narrative + simulation) requires careful type naming to avoid conflicts
7. **Swift 6 strict concurrency** - Modern Swift enforces actor isolation, requiring careful MainActor annotations

## 💡 Implementation Insights

### **What Makes This System Special:**

1. **Emergent Storytelling** - Player never sees the same moment twice, order varies based on choices
2. **Relationship Dynamics** - Trust/autonomy evolve naturally from choices, affecting city's voice
3. **Configurable Everything** - Every threshold, weight, and duration can be tuned without touching code
4. **Type Safety** - Enums prevent bugs, make code readable
5. **Separation of Concerns** - Data (CityMoment), Logic (MomentSelector), Presentation (CityVoice) cleanly separated

### **Why Procedural Selection Works:**

```
Story Choice → Increases story pattern affinity
            → MomentSelector weights invisibleConnection moments higher
            → Player sees more connection moments
            → Reinforces story-focused playstyle
            → Ends in Harmony/Archive/Symbiosis

Efficiency Choice → Decreases trust
                 → MomentSelector weights fragile moments higher
                 → Player sees vulnerable moments before destroying them
                 → Creates dramatic irony
                 → Ends in Optimization/Fragmentation
```

### **Why Relational Text Creates Depth:**

Each moment has 4 states:
- **First reveal**: "I notice something..."
- **If preserved**: "The flowers are still there. 1,247 mornings now..."
- **If destroyed**: "The bridge is more efficient now. There's no railing where the flowers used to rest..."
- **If remembered**: "They're not about the bridge, are they? They're about returning..."

This makes moments feel alive and reactive to player choices.

## 🔧 Debugging Session (October 19, 2025)

### Issue: Type Ambiguity Compilation Errors

**Problem:** Project failed to build with 9 type ambiguity errors after implementing the progression system.

**Root Cause:** Two parallel game systems in the codebase:
1. **City Simulation System** (original idle game) - Uses `TerminalCommand`, `CommandOutput`, `NarrativeEngine`
2. **Progression System** (new narrative game) - Used same type names

**Investigation Process:**
1. Ran `xcodebuild` to identify errors
2. Used `grep` to find all definitions of conflicting types
3. Discovered duplicate definitions across different systems
4. Analyzed which system should keep original names (city simulation)
5. Renamed types in progression system for clarity

**Resolution:**

| Original Name | Progression System | Simulation System |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| `TerminalCommand` | → `NarrativeCommand` | `TerminalCommand` ✓ |
| `CommandOutput` | → `NarrativeCommandOutput` | `CommandOutput` ✓ |
| `NarrativeEngine` | `NarrativeEngine` ✓ | → `SimulationNarrativeEngine` |

**Files Modified:**
- [ActProtocol.swift](idle_01/progression/systems/ActProtocol.swift) - Command type and parser
- [NarrativeEngine.swift](idle_01/progression/systems/NarrativeEngine.swift) - Engine and output type
- [ActOneManager.swift](idle_01/progression/systems/ActOneManager.swift) - Command handling
- [CityVoice.swift](idle_01/progression/systems/CityVoice.swift) - Easter egg signatures
- [SimulationEngine.swift](idle_01/game/SimulationEngine.swift) - Engine rename
- [VisualizationEngine.swift](idle_01/progression/systems/VisualizationEngine.swift) - Return type fix

**Additional Fix:**
- Changed `VisualizationEngine.asText()` return type from `Text` to `some View` (view modifiers return opaque types)

**Result:**
- ✅ Build succeeded with zero errors
- ⚠️ 14 Swift 6 concurrency warnings (expected, not blocking)
- ✅ Both systems now properly namespaced
- ✅ Type safety maintained

**Time to Resolution:** ~30 minutes

## 🎬 Conclusion

We've built a sophisticated narrative engine that creates emergent stories through procedural selection, weighted randomization, and relationship dynamics. The foundation is solid, extensible, and **all four acts are now fully implemented with complete ending epilogues**.

**Current Status:** Four complete, playable acts (I through IV) that deliver the full choice-driven narrative experience:
- **Act I: Awakening** - Observation and discovery (OBSERVE)
- **Act II: Stories Within** - Meaningful choices (REMEMBER, PRESERVE, OPTIMIZE) with bus route 47 decision
- **Act III: Weight of Choices** - Consequences visible (DECIDE, QUESTION, REFLECT) with infrastructure transformation
- **Act IV: What Remains** - Final reckoning (ACCEPT, RESIST, TRANSCEND) leading to one of 8 endings
- **All 8 Endings:** Complete with rich, personalized narrative epilogues (670+ lines) ✨ NEW

**Project builds successfully with zero errors.**

**Ready to Ship:** With 1-2 more hours of work (full playtest + verification of all 8 endings), this becomes a complete, polished narrative game ready for players.
