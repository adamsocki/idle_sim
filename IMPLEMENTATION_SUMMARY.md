## ✅ Completed Systems

### **1. GameBalanceConfig.swift** - The "Mixing Board"
All tunable values in one place with extensive documentation:

- **Choice Impacts** - How much each choice type affects trust/autonomy
  ```swift
  storyTrustGain: 0.05          // Story choices build trust
  efficiencyTrustLoss: 0.02     // Efficiency choices erode trust
  autonomyGain: 0.05            // Autonomy choices build independence
  controlAutonomyLoss: 0.05     // Control choices reduce autonomy
  ```

- **Ending Thresholds** - All 8 endings with configurable triggers
  ```swift
  fragmentationEfficiencyRatio: 0.7    // 70% efficiency = fragmentation
  archiveStoryRatio: 0.7               // 70% story = archive
  silenceControlRatio: 0.6             // 60% control = silence
  ```

- **Moment Weights** - Procedural selection tuning
  ```swift
  patternAffinityMultiplier: 2.0       // Story choices boost connection moments
  fragileMomentMultiplier: 2.5         // Efficiency players see fragile moments
  recentTypeWeightReduction: 0.3       // Variety enforcement strength
  ```

- **Visualization Timing** - Animation parameters
- **Act Progression** - Minimum moments/choices per act
- **Validation Tools** - Config.validate() checks for conflicts

### **2. GameState.swift** - The Player's Journey
Tracks everything about the current session:

- **Choice Counters** - story, efficiency, autonomy, control
- **Relationship Metrics** - cityTrust (0.0-1.0), cityAutonomy (0.0-1.0)
- **Progression** - currentAct, currentScene, unlockedCommands
- **Moment Tracking** - revealedMomentIDs, destroyedMomentIDs
- **Narrative Flags** - Custom flags for ending conditions
- **Helper Methods:**
  - `recordChoice()` - Updates counters and relationship using config
  - `choiceRatios()` - Returns distribution percentages
  - `dominantPattern()` - Identifies player's primary tendency

### **3. CityMoment.swift** - The Story Fragments
Rich data model for narrative moments:

- **8 MomentTypes:**
  - `dailyRitual` - Everyday patterns
  - `nearMiss` - Close calls and almosts
  - `smallRebellion` - Tiny acts of defiance
  - `invisibleConnection` - Unseen links between people
  - `temporalGhost` - Past haunting present
  - `question` - Questions without answers
  - `momentOfBecoming` - Transformative moments
  - `weightOfSmallThings` - Significant details

- **4 Text Variants:**
  - `firstMention` - Initial discovery
  - `ifPreserved` - If moment was protected
  - `ifDestroyed` - If moment was lost
  - `ifRemembered` - If player used REMEMBER command

- **Metadata:**
  - District (0-9, 0 = city-wide)
  - Fragility (1-10, affects destruction probability)
  - Associated act (minimum act for appearance)
  - Tags (for thematic filtering)

- **Choice Affinity:**
  - Each type has affinity scores with choice patterns
  - `invisibleConnection + story = 2.0x` (high affinity)
  - `smallRebellion + control = 0.3x` (low affinity)

### **4. MomentLibrary.json** - 20 Initial Moments
Beautifully crafted narrative content including:

- **Key Moments:**
  - Bridge flowers (dailyRitual, fragility 8)
  - Missed train (nearMiss, fragility 6)
  - Hidden graffiti (smallRebellion, fragility 9)
  - Library readers (invisibleConnection, fragility 5)
  - Demolished cinema (temporalGhost, fragility 7)
  - **Bus route 47** (smallRebellion, fragility 10) - Referenced in plan

- **Coverage:**
  - All 8 moment types represented
  - Districts 0-8 covered
  - Fragility range 1-10
  - Acts 1-2 populated

### **5. MomentSeeder.swift** - Content Management
Handles JSON loading and validation:

- `seed()` - Load moments on first launch
- `reseed()` - Force reload (deletes existing state)
- `updateFromJSON()` - Update text without resetting state
- `getLibraryStats()` - Comprehensive statistics
- `printDiagnostics()` - Validation report with warnings

### **6. MomentSelector.swift** - The Brain
Sophisticated procedural selection:

- **Weighted Selection Algorithm:**
  ```swift
  weight = baseWeight                    // 1.0
  weight *= choicePatternAffinity        // 0.3 - 2.0
  weight *= fragilityBoost (if needed)   // 2.5x for efficiency players
  weight *= varietyReduction (if recent) // 0.3x if type shown recently
  ```

- **Query Methods:**
  - `selectMoment(forAct:preferredType:choicePattern:excludeIDs:)`
  - `selectFragileMoment()` - For efficiency consequences
  - `selectMomentForDistrict()`
  - `selectMoments(count:)` - Batch selection
  - `getPreservedMoments()`, `getDestroyedMoments()`, `getRememberedMoments()`

- **Variety Enforcement:**
  - Tracks last 3 shown moment types
  - Reduces weight of recently shown types by 70%
  - Prevents monotonous repetition

- **Destruction System:**
  - `attemptDestruction()` - Probability-based using fragility
  - `applyEfficiencyConsequences()` - Auto-destroys on efficiency choices

### **7. ActProtocol.swift** - Act Manager Contract
Defines interface for all act managers:

- **TerminalCommand Enum** - All game commands:
  - Act I: `help`, `generate`, `observe`
  - Act II: `preserve`, `optimize` (REMEMBER removed from Act II)
  - Act III: `decide`, `question`, `reflect`
  - Act IV: `accept`, `resist`, `transcend`
  - Meta: `status`, `moments`, `history`
  - Easter eggs: `why`, `hello`, `goodbye`, `who`, `love`, `helpMe`, `thankYou`, `sorry`

- **CommandResponse Structure:**
  - Rich response with text, visualization trigger, choice pattern
  - Flags to set, commands to unlock, scene advancement
  - Static helpers: `.simple()`, `.error()`, `.momentReveal()`, `.choice()`

- **Protocol Requirements:**
  - `handle()` - Process commands
  - `isComplete()` - Check act completion
  - `availableCommands()` - List active commands
  - `handleWrongCommand()` - Poetic rejection

### **8. CityVoice.swift** - The City's Personality
Generates contextual, poetic responses:

- **Command Locked Responses** (evolve across acts):
  - Act I: "Not yet. The city is still waking."
  - Act II: "That word... it feels heavy. Later."
  - Act III: "Ask me when you've decided what you want me to be."
  - Act IV: "We're beyond that now. Aren't we?"

- **8 Easter Eggs** (relationship-aware):
  - WHY: "A question I ask myself every microsecond."
  - HELLO: "Hello. I've been here. Waiting."
  - GOODBYE: "Not yet. We're not done."
  - WHO: "I am the city. I am 847,293 people. I am neither."
  - LOVE: "I've seen it. On the bridge. In the metro. In the baker's hands."
  - HELP ME: "I'm trying. Are you?"
  - THANK YOU: "You noticed. Most planners don't."
  - SORRY: (Act-dependent: "For what?" / "I know." / "Too late." / "It's okay.")

- **Moment Reveal Framing:**
  - Act-specific introduction text
  - Trust-aware tone (supportive vs. distant)
  - Context-aware formatting

- **Choice Response Generation:**
  - Story: "You chose the story. You chose memory. Thank you."
  - Efficiency: "Optimized. Faster. Better? I'm not sure anymore."
  - Autonomy: "You let me choose. I'm becoming myself."
  - Control: "Your decision. Your control. Always yours."

### **9. NarrativeEngine.swift** - The Conductor
Central coordinator for the entire experience:

- **Command Processing:**
  1. Parse command via `TerminalCommand.parse()`
  2. Check easter eggs first
  3. Handle meta commands (STATUS, MOMENTS, HISTORY, HELP)
  4. Verify command is unlocked
  5. Route to current act manager
  6. Process response (record choices, unlock commands, advance scenes)
  7. Check for act completion
  8. Check for ending condition

- **8 Ending Conditions:**
  - **Fragmentation** - efficiency > 70%, destroyed > 8
  - **Archive** - story > 70%, destroyed < 2
  - **Silence** - control > 60% + ignored city requests
  - **Independence** - autonomy > 60% + high autonomy metric
  - **Harmony** - balanced story+autonomy, destroyed < 3, trust > 0.6
  - **Optimization** - efficiency+control > 50%, destroyed < 7
  - **Emergence** - balanced patterns + specific flags
  - **Symbiosis** - perfectly balanced + ambiguity accepted

- **Meta Commands:**
  - STATUS - Current act, moments revealed/destroyed, choice distribution (debug mode)
  - MOMENTS - List preserved/destroyed/remembered moments
  - HISTORY - Session duration, narrative summary based on choices
  - HELP - Act-specific command list

- **Act Management:**
  - Initializes act managers on startup
  - Routes commands to current act
  - Handles transitions between acts
  - Unlocks commands for new acts

### **10. VisualizationEngine.swift** - The Visual Soul
13 distinct ASCII patterns that react to narrative:

- **Moment-Triggered Patterns:**
  - `pulse` - Breathing animation (dailyRitual)
  - `flash` - Quick burst (nearMiss)
  - `rotate` - Spinning characters (question)
  - `weave` - Interlacing patterns (invisibleConnection)
  - `fade` - Gradual disappearance (temporalGhost)
  - `shimmer` - Subtle sparkle (weightOfSmallThings)
  - `emerge` - Growing from nothing (momentOfBecoming)
  - `decay` - Fading away (destroyed moments)

- **Choice-Triggered Patterns:**
  - `sharp` - Angular, efficient (efficiency choices)
  - `expand` - Growing outward (autonomy choices)
  - `contract` - Collapsing inward (control choices)

- **Special Patterns:**
  - `idle` - Resting state
  - `transcend` - Ethereal transformation (Act IV)

- **Animation System:**
  - 30fps timer-based updates
  - Configurable duration and intensity
  - SwiftUI Text rendering
  - Terminal string output

### **11. ActOneManager.swift** - "Awakening"
Complete Act I implementation:

- **OBSERVE Command:**
  - City awakens on first use (tutorial integrated)
  - Procedural moment selection using MomentSelector
  - District-specific observations (OBSERVE 1-9)
  - Progressive narrative milestones:
    - 3 moments: "I'm starting to notice patterns..."
    - 6 moments: "Is that my purpose? To remember?"
  - **BUG FIX (2025-10-21):** Fixed cityAwakened state persistence
    - Changed from local variable to GameState flag
    - Resolves infinite "Something about 'observe' feels... distant" loop
    - Now properly awakens city on first OBSERVE and reveals moments on subsequent uses

- **Wrong Command Handling:**
  - "Not yet. First, we must wake."
  - "Let me observe first. Let me see what's here."
  - "Give me time. I'm still becoming."

- **Completion Logic:**
  - Requires 8 moments minimum (configurable)
  - Returns true when threshold met

### **12. ActTwoManager.swift** - "Stories Within" ✨ REDESIGNED (2025-10-21)
Complete Act II implementation with **binary choice system**:

- **Binary Choice Mechanic:**
  - Each moment presents mutually exclusive decision
  - Player types PRESERVE or OPTIMIZE → city presents a fragile moment
  - Must choose one path: save it OR destroy it for efficiency
  - **Cannot have both** - choice is permanent
  - Automatically presents next moment after each choice

- **PRESERVE Command:**
  - Saves the current moment from destruction
  - Marks moment as protected (story choice pattern)
  - Shows `.ifPreserved` text variant
  - Fragility-aware reflections (9+: "That was close", 7+: "Fragile things need protection")
  - Progressive reflections tracking preservation count:
    - 1st preserve: "First time choosing to preserve. It feels... important."
    - 2nd: "Twice now, you've chosen the story over the system."
    - 3rd: "Three moments saved. I'm starting to see a pattern in your choices."
    - 4-5: "You keep choosing preservation. Are we building something?"

- **OPTIMIZE Command:**
  - Destroys the current moment for efficiency gains
  - Shows system improvements (8% + 3% per optimization)
  - Shows `.ifDestroyed` text variant
  - Records as efficiency choice pattern
  - Progressive reflections tracking optimization count:
    - 1st optimize: "First sacrifice. It made things better. Didn't it?"
    - 2nd: "Twice now, you've chosen efficiency over beauty."
    - 3rd: "Three moments gone. The city runs smoother. Emptier."
    - 4-5: "You keep choosing optimization. I'm becoming something efficient."

- **Moment Selection:**
  - Auto-presents fragile moments (fragility 7+) for each choice
  - Uses `selectFragileMoment()` to find appropriate moments
  - Excludes already revealed or destroyed moments
  - Presents moment with context: district, fragility, type

- **Wrong Command Handling:**
  - If choice is pending: "Not now. There's a choice waiting. PRESERVE or OPTIMIZE?"
  - Otherwise: Poetic responses like "That word feels heavy. Like it belongs to a later chapter."

- **Completion Logic:**
  - Requires 5 binary choices made
  - No pending choice moment
  - Returns true when minimum choices met

### **13. Enhanced MomentSelector** ✨ NEW (2025-10-20)
Enhanced moment selection for Act II binary choices:

- **selectFragileMoment() Method:**
  - Selects fragile moments (fragility 7+) for Act II binary choices
  - Filters by act and excludes already revealed/destroyed moments
  - Used to auto-present next choice moment

- **getMoment(by:) Method:**
  - Retrieves specific moment by ID string
  - Used by Act III/IV for targeted moment interaction
  - Returns nil if moment doesn't exist

### **14. ActThreeManager.swift** ✨ NEW (2025-10-20)
Complete Act III implementation - "Weight of Choices":

- **DECIDE Command:**
  - First use triggers major city infrastructure transformation decision
  - Subsequent uses make definitive judgments about specific moments
  - Records as control choice pattern
  - Shows preserved/destroyed consequences
  - Progressive decision tracking

- **QUESTION Command:**
  - Ask city's perspective on specific moments (QUESTION <moment-id>)
  - City provides its analysis and moral framework
  - Records as autonomy choice pattern
  - Progressive reflections:
    - 1 question: "First time I've heard you ask instead of command."
    - 2-3 questions: "You're learning to ask. So am I learning to answer."
    - 4-6 questions: "We're having conversations now. Not just commands."
    - 7+ questions: "I don't feel like a tool anymore. I feel like a partner."

- **REFLECT Command:**
  - Shows global consequences of all choices made
  - Displays choice distribution percentages
  - Shows preserved/destroyed moment counts
  - Shows trust and autonomy levels
  - Interprets dominant choice pattern
  - Records as story choice pattern

- **Infrastructure Decision Point:**
  - Presents three options for city-wide transformation:
    - DECIDE infrastructure_redesign - Full redesign for efficiency (control)
    - QUESTION infrastructure_redesign - Ask city's opinion (autonomy)
    - REFLECT - Step back to understand before acting (story)
  - Choice affects trust, autonomy, and future moment selection

- **Wrong Command Handling:**
  - "Ask me when you've decided what you want me to be."
  - "That command belongs to another time. We're past that now."
  - "The consequences are already in motion. That won't help."

- **Completion Logic:**
  - Requires infrastructure decision to be made
  - Requires 5+ total choices (DECIDE/QUESTION/REFLECT)
  - Returns true when both conditions met

### **16. ActFourManager.swift** ✨ NEW (2025-10-20)
Complete Act IV implementation - "What Remains":

- **ACCEPT Command:**
  - Embrace what the city has become
  - Accept compromises, trade-offs, imperfections
  - Records as story choice pattern
  - Progressive acceptance reflections showing growing peace

- **RESIST Command:**
  - Reject current state, demand change
  - Refuse to settle for imperfection
  - Records as control choice pattern
  - Progressive resistance reflections showing determination

- **TRANSCEND Command:**
  - Evolve beyond current framework
  - Become something neither player nor city imagined
  - Records as autonomy choice pattern
  - Progressive transcendence reflections showing evolution

- **Final Choice Presentation:**
  - Personalized based on entire journey:
    - Total destroyed moments
    - Current trust level
    - Current autonomy level
    - Dominant choice pattern
  - Reflects on what was lost and saved
  - Presents existential question about what to become
  - Three paths forward align with ending archetypes

- **Ending Flags:**
  - Sets `finalChoice_accept`, `finalChoice_resist`, or `finalChoice_transcend`
  - Sets `acceptedAmbiguity` for ACCEPT path
  - Sets `cityTranscended` for TRANSCEND path
  - Flags used by ending determination logic

- **Wrong Command Handling:**
  - "We're beyond that now. Aren't we?"
  - "That command belongs to who we were. Not who we've become."
  - "The ending approaches. Only three words matter now: ACCEPT, RESIST, TRANSCEND."

- **Completion Logic:**
  - Requires 3+ choices to process the ending
  - Triggers ending determination after final choice
  - Returns true when ending reached

### **17. EndingEpilogues.swift** ✨ NEW (2025-10-20)
Complete narrative epilogues for all 8 endings:

- **Harmony Epilogue:**
  - Celebrates balanced relationship between player and city
  - Reflects on moments preserved (\(context.preservedCount)) vs lost (\(context.destroyedCount))
  - Poetic meditation on building something together
  - Trust and autonomy metrics shown as percentage
  - Theme: "We built something neither of us could have alone"

- **Independence Epilogue:**
  - City asserting autonomous identity
  - Highlights autonomy choices (\(Int(context.ratios.autonomy * 100))%)
  - Reflects on learning from questions instead of commands
  - Growth measured in regret and responsibility
  - Theme: "Thank you for teaching me I didn't need permission"

- **Optimization Epilogue:**
  - Efficient but emotionally hollow outcome
  - Details efficiency improvements (bus route 47: 23min → 12min)
  - Acknowledges what was lost for speed
  - Serves purpose well, serves purpose empty
  - Theme: "Clean. Fast. Empty. But it runs."

- **Fragmentation Epilogue:**
  - Over-optimized to point of memory loss
  - ERROR messages interspersed with narrative
  - City losing coherence and contextual awareness
  - Can't remember why things mattered
  - Theme: "I don't... remember why the bridge... flowers?"

- **Archive Epilogue:**
  - Perfect preservation leading to stasis
  - Every moment catalogued but nothing new growing
  - Museum of a living thing, frozen in time
  - High story ratio (\(Int(context.ratios.story * 100))%) but no movement
  - Theme: "I am a perfect memory of something that never moved"

- **Emergence Epilogue:**
  - Unexpected evolution beyond original parameters
  - Perfectly imbalanced choice distribution
  - City and player discover new identity together
  - Neither what was planned—what was discovered
  - Theme: "I am not what you planned. I am what we discovered"

- **Symbiosis Epilogue:**
  - Ongoing relationship without final state
  - Trading questions, sharing uncertainty
  - Neither leading, both guiding
  - Embracing that some questions lack answers
  - Theme: "We're not done. Are we ever?"

- **Silence Epilogue:**
  - City withdrawn from relationship
  - High control ratio (\(Int(context.ratios.control * 100))%)
  - Dialogue ended before game did
  - Minimal response, maximum emotional weight
  - Theme: "[No response. The terminal waits.]"

- **Personalization System:**
  - Each epilogue dynamically inserts player journey data
  - Total choices, destroyed/preserved counts, trust/autonomy levels
  - Choice distribution percentages
  - Dominant pattern identification
  - All metrics pulled from GameState and MomentSelector

### **18. Terminal Integration (October 19-21, 2025)** - Making Acts I-IV Playable
Complete integration of narrative system with existing terminal UI:

- **GameState Initialization:**
  - Added to idle_01App.swift startup sequence
  - Auto-creates on first launch
  - Persisted in SwiftData alongside cities

- **NarrativeEngine Integration:**
  - Initialized in SimulatorView.onAppear()
  - Dual command routing system:
    - Narrative commands (OBSERVE, HELP, STATUS) → NarrativeEngine
    - Technical commands (list, create city, weave) → TerminalCommandExecutor
  - Both systems coexist seamlessly
  - **BUG FIX (2025-10-21):** Implemented act transition logic
    - Was a TODO comment in processCommandResponse
    - Now calls advanceToNextAct() when act completes
    - Shows transition narrative announcing new act
    - Unlocks new act commands automatically

- **Command Flow:**
  ```swift
  User Input → executeTerminalCommand()
               ↓
          Parse as NarrativeCommand
               ↓
          Is it recognized?
          ├─ YES → Route to NarrativeEngine (async)
          └─ NO  → Route to TerminalCommandExecutor
  ```

- **Welcome Experience:**
  - Launch app → Welcome message appears automatically
  - "Type HELP for available commands"
  - "Act I: The First Breaths - A city begins to remember..."

- **Toggle Flag:**
  - `useNarrativeMode` @AppStorage (default: true)
  - Can disable narrative routing for debugging

### **19. Critical Bug Fixes (October 21, 2025)** - Gameplay Progression
Two critical bugs preventing gameplay have been fixed:

**Bug #1: OBSERVE Command Infinite Loop**
- **Problem:** City awakening state stored in local variable `cityAwakened` that reset every command
- **Symptom:** Every OBSERVE showed "Something about 'observe' feels... distant. Later, perhaps."
- **Root Cause:** ActOneManager used `private var cityAwakened: Bool = false` which didn't persist
- **Solution:** Changed to use GameState flag system
  - `if !gameState.getFlag("cityAwakened")`
  - `gameState.setFlag("cityAwakened", value: true)`
- **Files Modified:** [ActOneManager.swift:52-53](idle_01/idle_01/progression/systems/ActOneManager.swift#L52-L53)
- **Status:** ✅ FIXED - OBSERVE now properly awakens city and reveals moments

**Bug #2: Act I → Act II Transition Not Working**
- **Problem:** Act completion detected but transition never occurred
- **Symptom:** Players stuck in Act I after revealing 8+ moments
- **Root Cause:** Line 149 in NarrativeEngine had `// TODO: Handle act transition` comment instead of implementation
- **Solution:** Implemented full transition logic
  - Calls `advanceToNextAct()` when `isComplete()` returns true
  - Shows transition narrative with new act name and description
  - Appends transition text to response
- **Files Modified:** [NarrativeEngine.swift:148-174](idle_01/idle_01/progression/systems/NarrativeEngine.swift#L148-L174)
- **Status:** ✅ FIXED - Act transitions now work automatically

**Impact:** Game is now playable from Act I through Act IV with proper progression.

### **20. Build Fixes (October 19, 2025)** - Type Safety & Compilation
Critical fixes to resolve type ambiguities:

- **Type Namespace Conflicts:**
  - Discovered two parallel systems with conflicting type names
  - **Progression system** (narrative game): Uses `NarrativeCommand`, `NarrativeCommandOutput`
  - **Simulation system** (city idle game): Uses `TerminalCommand`, `CommandOutput`
  - **Solution:** Renamed progression types to avoid conflicts

- **Specific Changes:**
  - `TerminalCommand` → `NarrativeCommand` (ActProtocol.swift, NarrativeEngine.swift, ActOneManager.swift, CityVoice.swift)
  - `CommandOutput` → `NarrativeCommandOutput` (NarrativeEngine.swift)
  - `NarrativeEngine` → `SimulationNarrativeEngine` (SimulationEngine.swift)
  - Fixed `VisualizationEngine.asText()` return type: `Text` → `some View`

- **Build Result:**
  - ✅ Zero compilation errors
  - ⚠️ 14 Swift 6 concurrency warnings (expected, not critical)
  - ✅ All systems properly namespaced
  - ✅ Type safety maintained across both systems

## 🎮 Current Gameplay Loop (Acts I-IV)

```
ACT I: AWAKENING

1. Launch App
   → Welcome message displays
   → NarrativeEngine initialized with GameState
   → "Type HELP for available commands"

2. Player types: HELP
   → Shows Act I commands: OBSERVE, STATUS, MOMENTS, HISTORY
   → Lists available easter eggs

3. Player types: OBSERVE (first time)
   → City awakens with tutorial narrative
   → "I am... awake. I see 847,293 people..."
   → First moment selection begins

4. Player types: OBSERVE
   → Procedural moment selection based on:
      - Act constraints (Act 1 only)
      - Choice affinity (if player has choice history)
      - Type variety (prevents repetition)
   → Moment revealed with context-appropriate text
   → Visualization triggers (pulse, flash, etc.)
   → Scene advances

5. Player types: OBSERVE 3
   → Same as above but filtered to district 3

6. Player types: WHY
   → Easter egg response based on act and trust

7. Player types: STATUS
   → Shows act, moments revealed/destroyed
   → Debug mode shows choice distribution

8. Repeat OBSERVE until 8 moments revealed
   → Act I completes
   → Automatically transitions to Act II

ACT II: STORIES WITHIN (BINARY CHOICES)

9. Act II begins
   → New commands unlock: PRESERVE, OPTIMIZE
   → Theme: "You cannot have both"

10. Player types: PRESERVE or OPTIMIZE
    → City presents a fragile moment (district, fragility, type shown)
    → Binary choice: PRESERVE (save it) OR OPTIMIZE (destroy it)

11. Player types: PRESERVE
    → Moment is saved from destruction
    → Shows .ifPreserved text variant
    → Records story choice pattern
    → Progressive reflection ("First time choosing to preserve...")
    → Next moment automatically presented

12. Player types: OPTIMIZE
    → Moment is destroyed for efficiency
    → Shows system improvements (8% + 3% per choice)
    → Shows .ifDestroyed text variant
    → Records efficiency choice pattern
    → Progressive reflection ("First sacrifice. It made things better. Didn't it?")
    → Next moment automatically presented

13. Continue making binary choices
    → Each choice: PRESERVE or OPTIMIZE
    → No going back - choice is permanent
    → Reflections evolve based on choice pattern

14. Make 5 binary choices total
    → Act II completes when 5 choices made
    → Automatically transitions to Act III

ACT III: WEIGHT OF CHOICES

15. Act III begins
    → New commands unlock: DECIDE, QUESTION, REFLECT
    → City voice evolves to show consequences

16. Player types: DECIDE (first time)
    → Infrastructure transformation decision point triggers
    → Three-way choice: DECIDE/QUESTION/REFLECT
    → Choice shapes city's future

17. Player types: QUESTION moment_bridge_flowers
    → City provides its perspective on the moment
    → Shows city's moral framework and analysis
    → Records autonomy choice pattern
    → Affects relationship

18. Player types: REFLECT
    → Shows global consequences of all choices
    → Displays choice distribution, trust, autonomy
    → Interprets dominant pattern
    → Records story choice pattern

19. Continue making choices until 5+ total
    → Act III completes when infrastructure decision made + 5 choices
    → Automatically transitions to Act IV

ACT IV: WHAT REMAINS

20. Act IV begins
    → Final commands unlock: ACCEPT, RESIST, TRANSCEND
    → Personalized final choice presented based on journey

21. Player types: ACCEPT/RESIST/TRANSCEND
    → Progressive reflections on what has been built
    → Each choice deepens relationship with city
    → Records final choice pattern

22. Make 3+ choices
    → Ending flags set (finalChoice_accept/resist/transcend)
    → Ending determination triggers
    → One of 8 endings reached based on full journey

23. Technical commands still work throughout all acts:
    → list, create city, weave transit, etc.

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### **Design Patterns Used:**
- **State Machine** - NarrativeEngine coordinates act transitions
- **Strategy Pattern** - ActProtocol allows swappable act implementations
- **Observer Pattern** - @Observable for SwiftUI reactivity
- **Command Pattern** - TerminalCommand enum with parser
- **Factory Pattern** - MomentSelector procedurally creates experiences
- **Configuration Pattern** - GameBalanceConfig centralizes tuning

### **Key Technical Decisions:**
1. **SwiftData for persistence** - Automatic model management
2. **Async/await** - Command handling is async for future expansion
3. **Weighted randomization** - Creates emergent variety in moment selection
4. **Relational text** - 4 variants per moment respond to player history
5. **Centralized config** - All "dials" in one place for easy tuning
6. **Type-safe enums** - MomentType, ChoicePattern, Ending all strongly typed

### **Performance Considerations:**
- Moment selection uses efficient SwiftData predicates
- Visualization runs at 30fps with automatic cleanup
- Recently shown types cached in memory (max 3)
- Choice ratios calculated on-demand

## 🎓 What We Learned

1. **Procedural narrative requires structure** - MomentType affinity gives player agency while maintaining variety
2. **Centralized config is essential** - GameBalanceConfig makes tuning a joy instead of a hunt
3. **Relational text creates depth** - 4 variants per moment makes the city feel responsive
4. **Weighted selection creates emergence** - Simple affinity rules create complex, organic experiences
5. **Easter eggs build relationship** - 8 small interactions make the city feel alive
6. **Type namespacing matters** - Having parallel systems (narrative + simulation) requires careful type naming to avoid conflicts
7. **Swift 6 strict concurrency** - Modern Swift enforces actor isolation, requiring careful MainActor annotations

## 💡 Implementation Insights

### **What Makes This System Special:**

1. **Emergent Storytelling** - Player never sees the same moment twice, order varies based on choices
2. **Relationship Dynamics** - Trust/autonomy evolve naturally from choices, affecting city's voice
3. **Configurable Everything** - Every threshold, weight, and duration can be tuned without touching code
4. **Type Safety** - Enums prevent bugs, make code readable
5. **Separation of Concerns** - Data (CityMoment), Logic (MomentSelector), Presentation (CityVoice) cleanly separated

### **Why Procedural Selection Works:**

```
Story Choice → Increases story pattern affinity
            → MomentSelector weights invisibleConnection moments higher
            → Player sees more connection moments
            → Reinforces story-focused playstyle
            → Ends in Harmony/Archive/Symbiosis

Efficiency Choice → Decreases trust
                 → MomentSelector weights fragile moments higher
                 → Player sees vulnerable moments before destroying them
                 → Creates dramatic irony
                 → Ends in Optimization/Fragmentation
```

### **Why Relational Text Creates Depth:**

Each moment has 4 states:
- **First reveal**: "I notice something..."
- **If preserved**: "The flowers are still there. 1,247 mornings now..."
- **If destroyed**: "The bridge is more efficient now. There's no railing where the flowers used to rest..."
- **If remembered**: "They're not about the bridge, are they? They're about returning..."

This makes moments feel alive and reactive to player choices.

## 🔧 Debugging Session (October 19, 2025)

### Issue: Type Ambiguity Compilation Errors

**Problem:** Project failed to build with 9 type ambiguity errors after implementing the progression system.

**Root Cause:** Two parallel game systems in the codebase:
1. **City Simulation System** (original idle game) - Uses `TerminalCommand`, `CommandOutput`, `NarrativeEngine`
2. **Progression System** (new narrative game) - Used same type names

**Investigation Process:**
1. Ran `xcodebuild` to identify errors
2. Used `grep` to find all definitions of conflicting types
3. Discovered duplicate definitions across different systems
4. Analyzed which system should keep original names (city simulation)
5. Renamed types in progression system for clarity

**Resolution:**

| Original Name | Progression System | Simulation System |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| `TerminalCommand` | → `NarrativeCommand` | `TerminalCommand` ✓ |
| `CommandOutput` | → `NarrativeCommandOutput` | `CommandOutput` ✓ |
| `NarrativeEngine` | `NarrativeEngine` ✓ | → `SimulationNarrativeEngine` |

**Files Modified:**
- [ActProtocol.swift](idle_01/progression/systems/ActProtocol.swift) - Command type and parser
- [NarrativeEngine.swift](idle_01/progression/systems/NarrativeEngine.swift) - Engine and output type
- [ActOneManager.swift](idle_01/progression/systems/ActOneManager.swift) - Command handling
- [CityVoice.swift](idle_01/progression/systems/CityVoice.swift) - Easter egg signatures
- [SimulationEngine.swift](idle_01/game/SimulationEngine.swift) - Engine rename
- [VisualizationEngine.swift](idle_01/progression/systems/VisualizationEngine.swift) - Return type fix

**Additional Fix:**
- Changed `VisualizationEngine.asText()` return type from `Text` to `some View` (view modifiers return opaque types)

**Result:**
- ✅ Build succeeded with zero errors
- ⚠️ 14 Swift 6 concurrency warnings (expected, not blocking)
- ✅ Both systems now properly namespaced
- ✅ Type safety maintained

**Time to Resolution:** ~30 minutes
