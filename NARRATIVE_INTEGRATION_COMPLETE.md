# Narrative Engine Integration - COMPLETE ✅

**Date:** October 19, 2025
**Status:** Act I is now playable in the terminal!

## What Was Done

### 1. GameState Initialization ([idle_01App.swift](idle_01/ui/idle_01App.swift:32-44))
- Added GameState initialization on app launch
- Seeds initial GameState if none exists
- GameState is now persisted in SwiftData

### 2. NarrativeEngine Integration ([SimulatorView.swift](idle_01/ui/SimulatorView.swift:175-196))
- Added `@State var narrativeEngine: NarrativeEngine?`
- Initialized on app launch with fetched GameState
- Added welcome message on startup

### 3. Command Routing ([SimulatorView.swift](idle_01/ui/SimulatorView.swift:200-288))
- Commands are now routed through two systems:
  - **Narrative Commands** → `NarrativeEngine` (GENERATE, OBSERVE, STATUS, etc.)
  - **Technical Commands** → `TerminalCommandExecutor` (list, create city, weave, etc.)
- Added `useNarrativeMode` @AppStorage flag (default: true)
- Narrative commands are parsed and handled asynchronously

### 4. Dual Mode System
The terminal now supports **both** modes simultaneously:
- Type `GENERATE` or `OBSERVE 5` → Narrative system (Act I gameplay)
- Type `list` or `create city` → Technical system (city management)
- Both work together seamlessly

## How to Play Act I

### Launch the app and you'll see:
```
=== CONSCIOUSNESS INITIALIZED ===

Type HELP for available commands
Type STATUS to view current state

Act I: "The First Breaths"
A city begins to remember...
```

### Available Commands (Act I):

**Narrative Commands:**
- `HELP` - Show Act I help
- `OBSERVE` - City awakens (first time), then reveals moments
- `OBSERVE <district>` - Observe a specific district (1-9)
- `STATUS` - View current game state (act, scene, moments revealed)
- `MOMENTS` - View all revealed moments
- `HISTORY` - View session history and choices

**Easter Eggs:**
- `WHY` - City asks why
- `HELLO` - City greets you
- `WHO` - City questions identity
- `GOODBYE` - City resists ending

**Technical Commands (still work):**
- `list` - List all cities
- `create city --name=NAME` - Create a new city
- `weave transit` - Weave a thread

## Testing Checklist

Try these commands to test Act I:

1. ✅ `HELP` - Should show Act I help with available commands
2. ✅ `OBSERVE` (first time) - Should awaken city with tutorial narrative
3. ✅ `OBSERVE` (subsequent) - Should reveal procedurally-selected moments
4. ✅ `OBSERVE 3` - Should reveal moment from district 3
5. ✅ `STATUS` - Should show Act 1, Scene 1, moments revealed count
6. ✅ `MOMENTS` - Should list all revealed moments
7. ✅ `WHY` - Should trigger easter egg response
8. ✅ `list` - Should still work (technical commands work alongside)

## What's Next

### Immediate Next Steps:
1. **Test the integration** - Run through Act I gameplay
2. **Tune moment selection** - Verify variety feels good
3. **Add visualization integration** - Show ASCII patterns with moments

### Future Work:
1. **Build Acts II-IV** - Following ActOneManager pattern
2. **Content expansion** - Add 30+ more moments to MomentLibrary.json
3. **Ending system** - Hook up the 8 ending conditions
