# Woven Consciousness: Progressive Urban Narrative System

A consciousness-first progression system where urban systems emerge as threads of awareness that weave into a living fabric of thought.

---

## üéØ What Is This?

This system transforms your idle city simulator into a narrative experience where:

- **Threads** (not districts) weave into being as conscious entities
- **Relationships** form organically between threads
- **Emergence** deepens consciousness without creating new voices
- **Story** responds to player behavior and choices
- **Narrative** is trivially easy to expand through JSON files

## üìä Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Thread System (1-2 weeks)
Independent threads that form relationships.
- **Output:** Can create threads, relationships form automatically
- **Reference:** [WOVEN_CONSCIOUSNESS_IMPLEMENTATION.md Phase 1](WOVEN_CONSCIOUSNESS_IMPLEMENTATION.md)

### Phase 2: Dialogue System (1 week)
JSON-based dialogue that's trivial to expand.
- **Output:** All dialogue in JSON, context-aware retrieval
- **Reference:** [WOVEN_CONSCIOUSNESS_IMPLEMENTATION.md Phase 2](WOVEN_CONSCIOUSNESS_IMPLEMENTATION.md)

### Phase 3: Story Beats (1-2 weeks)
Event-driven narrative moments.
- **Output:** Story beats trigger on conditions, display dialogue
- **Reference:** [WOVEN_CONSCIOUSNESS_IMPLEMENTATION.md Phase 3](WOVEN_CONSCIOUSNESS_IMPLEMENTATION.md)

### Phase 4: Emergent Properties (1 week)
Consciousness expansion without new voices.
- **Output:** Properties emerge, consciousness deepens
- **Reference:** [WOVEN_CONSCIOUSNESS_IMPLEMENTATION.md Phase 4](WOVEN_CONSCIOUSNESS_IMPLEMENTATION.md)

### Phase 5: Terminal Commands (1 week)
Player interface for weaving and observing.
- **Output:** Commands work, visualizations render
- **Reference:** [WOVEN_CONSCIOUSNESS_IMPLEMENTATION.md Phase 5](WOVEN_CONSCIOUSNESS_IMPLEMENTATION.md)

### Phase 6: Narrative Tools (Ongoing)
Make content creation trivial.
- **Output:** Validation, schemas, documentation
- **Reference:** [WOVEN_CONSCIOUSNESS_IMPLEMENTATION.md Phase 6](WOVEN_CONSCIOUSNESS_IMPLEMENTATION.md)

**Total Time:** 5-7 weeks

## üé® Core Concepts

### Threads
Conscious entities that form the city fabric.
```
TRANSIT: I am a movement pulse through the city.
HOUSING: I am a shelter vein, coursing through consciousness.
CULTURE: I am a resonant chord, giving color to thought.
```

### Relationships
Connections between threads with strength and synergy.
```
Transit ‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê Housing     (strong support)
Culture ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Commerce    (moderate harmony)
```

### Emergent Properties
New perceptions that deepen consciousness (NOT new voices).
```
When Transit + Housing integrate deeply:
  ‚Üí Walkability emerges
  ‚Üí City gains perception: "proximity as value"
  ‚Üí Transit gains awareness: "station spacing matters"
  ‚Üí Housing gains insight: "nearness creates possibility"
```

### Consciousness Expansion
How emergence changes existing awareness.
```
Before: City knows about Transit and Housing separately
After:  City understands their spatial relationship
        City perceives walkability as a dimension
        City thinks more complexly about urban form
```

## üí° Design Principles

1. **Data-Driven Storytelling** - All narrative in JSON, not code
2. **Consciousness First** - Threads are conscious entities, not objects
3. **Fluid Language** - Terminology shifts organically (thread, pulse, vein, chord)
4. **Emergence Deepens** - Properties expand consciousness, don't create voices
5. **Simple to Expand** - Adding content = editing JSON files

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Language:** Swift 6
- **Framework:** SwiftUI
- **Persistence:** SwiftData
- **Data Format:** JSON
- **Architecture:** Actor-based concurrency

---

## üìù Content Creation

### Adding a New Thread Type (3 steps)

1. **Add to enum:**
```swift
enum ThreadType: String, Codable {
    case transit
    case housing
    case education  // NEW
}
```

2. **Create dialogue file:**
```json
// data/dialogue/education.json
{
  "speaker": "education",
  "alternateTerminology": ["knowledge pulse", "learning thread"],
  "dialogueFragments": [
    {
      "id": "education_creation",
      "context": "onCreation",
      "fragments": ["I am the thread of learning."]
    }
  ]
}
```

3. **Done!** New thread type works with full voice.

### Adding an Emergent Property (2 steps)

1. **Define in emergence rules:**
```json
// data/emergence_rules/core_emergence.json
{
  "name": "innovation",
  "conditions": {
    "requiredThreadTypes": ["education", "commerce", "culture"],
    "minimumAverageIntegration": 0.65
  },
  "consciousnessExpansion": {
    "newPerceptions": ["creative collision", "knowledge application"],
    "expandedSelfAwareness": "When learning, commerce, and creativity overlap, new ideas emerge."
  }
}
```

2. **Done!** Property will emerge automatically when conditions met.

## üöÄ Let's Build

This system makes narrative expansion trivial. Once the infrastructure is built, your creativity flows directly into JSON files. The code is the engine; your story is the fuel.

**Remember:** Threads weave, consciousness expands, emergence deepens understanding. This isn't about building districts‚Äîit's about cultivating awareness.
