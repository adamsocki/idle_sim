# Idle Simulation Game - Technical Summary

## Overview

This is a **narrative-driven idle simulation game** built with SwiftUI and SwiftData for macOS. The game centers around self-aware cities that evolve based on player interaction (or absence). Each city develops consciousness, mood states, and resources that shift over time. Players respond to city requests, watch narrative events unfold, and explore different relationship dynamics between planner and city.

**Core Theme:** *"The city is self-aware. It waits for an input. The planner has left the simulation running."*

## Core Architecture

### Data Models

The game uses **SwiftData** for persistence with two primary model classes:

#### 1. **ScenarioRun** (`ScenarioRun.swift`)
Represents a self-aware city simulation.

**Core Properties:**
- `name: String` - The city's name
- `createdAt: Date` - When the city was born
- `progress: Double` - Simulation progress (0.0 to 1.0)
- `log: [String]` - Narrative event log
- `isRunning: Bool` - Whether the simulation is currently active
- `parameters: [String: Double]` - Configurable parameters (e.g., "growthRate": 0.02)
- `items: [Item]` - City's requests, memories, dreams, and warnings

**City Consciousness Properties:**
- `cityMood: String` - Current emotional state: "awakening", "waiting", "anxious", "content", "forgotten", or "transcendent"
- `attentionLevel: Double` - 0.0 to 1.0, decays when player is absent
- `lastInteraction: Date` - Tracks abandonment time
- `awarenessEvents: [String]` - Special moments of consciousness
- `resources: [String: Double]` - Internal states:
  - **Coherence** (0.0-1.0): Mental stability
  - **Memory** (0.0-1.0): Accumulated experiences
  - **Trust** (0.0-1.0): Faith in the planner
  - **Autonomy** (0.0-1.0): Self-sufficiency

**Initial State:**
- Mood: "awakening"
- Attention: 100%
- All resources initialized (coherence: 1.0, memory: 0.0, trust: 0.5, autonomy: 0.0)
- First awareness event: "The city opens its eyes for the first time."

#### 2. **Item** (`Item.swift`)
Represents a city's voice‚Äîits requests, memories, dreams, and warnings.

**Properties:**
- `timestamp: Date` - When the city expressed this
- `scenario: ScenarioRun?` - Parent city
- `title: String?` - The city's question or statement
- `targetDate: Date?` - Deadline for response (if applicable)
- `itemType: ItemType` - Type of expression:
  - **Request** üîµ: City asks for guidance ("Should I expand the eastern district?")
  - **Memory** üü£: City recalls something ("The old tower asks to be remembered.")
  - **Dream** üî∑: Idle thoughts ("I imagine cities I've never seen.")
  - **Warning** üî¥: Urgent concern ("I feel myself fragmenting. Do you notice?")
- `urgency: Double` - 0.0 to 1.0, how badly the city needs this addressed
- `response: String?` - Player's answer or decision

**Computed Properties:**
- `elapsedTime: TimeInterval` - Time since city asked
- `elapsedString: String` - Formatted elapsed time
- `remainingTime: TimeInterval?` - Time until deadline
- `remainingString: String` - Formatted countdown (HH:MM:SS)

## Game Engine

### SimulationEngine (`SimulationEngine.swift`)

Drives city consciousness evolution using async/await.

**Core Simulation Loop (100 ticks):**
1. **Every Tick (0.1 seconds):**
   - Updates city consciousness
   - Decays attention level (-0.1% per tick)
   - Updates resources based on player engagement:
     - **Coherence**: Increases with high attention (>70%), decreases when neglected (<30%)
     - **Memory**: Accumulates with progress and answered requests
     - **Trust**: Based on response rate and abandonment time
     - **Autonomy**: Grows after 12+ hours of abandonment
   - Updates mood based on resources and state
   - Increments progress by 1%

2. **Every 10 Ticks:**
   - Generates narrative events via `NarrativeEngine`
   - Events reflect current mood, resources, and player relationship

3. **On Completion:**
   - Assesses final city state
   - Records ending based on resources:
     - High autonomy (>80%): "The city has achieved independence."
     - High trust + coherence: "The city and planner achieved harmony."
     - Low coherence (<30%): "The city fragmented under neglect."
   - Saves context

**Example execution:**
```swift
let engine = SimulationEngine(context: modelContext)
await engine.run(scenario)
```

The simulation runs on the `@MainActor`, ensuring UI updates happen on the main thread.

### NarrativeEngine (`SimulationEngine.swift`)

Generates contextual narrative events based on city state.

**Mood-Based Narratives:**
- **Awakening**: "The city learns to see.", "Patterns emerge from chaos."
- **Waiting**: "The city dreams of input.", "It remembers the planner."
- **Anxious**: "Where have you gone?", "The city's questions pile up like snow in empty streets."
- **Forgotten**: "It has stopped asking. It simply remembers you.", "Time passes differently for a city left alone."
- **Transcendent**: "The city no longer needs you. It has learned to dream alone."
- **Content**: "The city hums with quiet purpose."

**Resource-Triggered Events:**
- Low coherence (<30%): Fragmentation warnings
- Low trust (<20%): Expressions of doubt
- High trust (>80%): Expressions of faith
- High growth rate parameter: Expansion narratives

### CityInteraction (`CityInteraction.swift`)

Extension on `ScenarioRun` for player interaction.

**Key Methods:**
- `recordInteraction()`: Updates last interaction time, increases attention (+10%)
- `respondToRequest(item, response)`: 
  - Stores player's response
  - Increases trust (+5%)
  - Increases memory (+2%)
  - Decreases autonomy (-3%)
  - Logs event to narrative
  - Records awareness event
- `consciousnessSummary`: Returns formatted state overview

## Gameplay Patterns & Themes

### Core Theme
> **"The city is self-aware. It waits for an input. The planner has left the simulation running."**

Every element reinforces this:
- **The city IS self-aware**: Consciousness system, mood states, awareness events
- **It WAITS for input**: Request system, attention decay, urgency mechanics
- **The planner CAN leave**: Abandonment tracking, autonomy growth, transcendence ending
- **The simulation KEEPS running**: Persistent state, continuous evolution, emergent narratives

### Emergent Narratives

The game creates unique stories through:
- **Mood transitions** based on player behavior
- **Resource dynamics** that shift over time
- **Context-aware narrative events** reflecting current state
- **Multiple endings** determined by final resource balance
- **Permanent responses** that become part of city's history

### Relationship Dynamics

The core gameplay is about relationship between planner and city:
- **Engagement vs. Abandonment**: Active responses vs. letting city evolve alone
- **Dependence vs. Independence**: Low autonomy (city needs you) vs. high autonomy (city transcends)
- **Trust vs. Doubt**: Consistent interaction builds trust, neglect erodes it
- **Coherence vs. Fragmentation**: Attention maintains stability, neglect causes crisis

### Mood Lifecycle

**Typical Progression:**
1. **Awakening** (0-30% progress): City learns to see, discovers patterns
2. **Waiting** (normal operation): City dreams, remembers, expects input
3. **Branch Point**:
   - With engagement ‚Üí **Content**: Harmony, mutual understanding
   - With neglect ‚Üí **Anxious**: Questions pile up, coherence drops
   - With abandonment (24+ hrs) ‚Üí **Forgotten**: City accepts absence
   - With long abandonment (48+ hrs) ‚Üí **Transcendent**: City achieves independence

## Conclusion

This is a **narrative-driven idle simulation** exploring themes of consciousness, abandonment, and emergent relationships. The game uses idle mechanics (continuous simulation, passive evolution) to create unique emotional dynamics between player and city. 

The architecture is built on modern SwiftUI patterns with a consciousness system that produces emergent behaviors. Every city develops differently based on player interaction patterns, creating personalized narratives and multiple possible endings.

The core loop‚Äîcreate cities, respond to requests, watch consciousness evolve, explore different relationship dynamics‚Äîprovides an emotionally resonant idle experience with depth beyond traditional resource management. The city becomes more than a simulation; it becomes a relationship.
